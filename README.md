This site shows a set of random recent updates of the OpenStreetMap Database. For the moment only new ways are displayed.

Most of the client code was written by me about a year ago, but I didnt have a reliable server end at hand providing the feed of updates, so I shelved the project. This changed with osmStream, and the Overpass API, which resulted in Show me the way, a very similar visualisation written by Ian Dees. Thus hats off to them, their work enabled me to finally complete this visualisation!
